Virtualazation in AWS: 
<br>Hypervisor: Type1 & Type2
<br> XEN Hypervisor: 
<br> AWS vs Azure vs GCP: Aws have more availability zone, Old, 
<br> GCP is a leader in AI/ML.
<br> EC2: Elastic compute cloud,  Various CPU, Memory, Storage available.
<br> Combination of instance type: 
<br> Intance Type: 1.General Purpose type, 2. Memory Optipmized,3. Storage Optimize, 4: Acceletarted ,5 : compute optimized.
<br> <b> AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
<br> Operating System, Architecture, Storage, Virtualization
<br> Replication previous machine.
<br><b> Regions & Availability Zones:
<br> Region: Geolocation Data Center
<br> Zone: within the Region for HA.
<br> <b> EBS (Elastic Block Storage):
<br> Partion & create logical volume
<br> EBS is unformated, Throughtput: data transfer per second, IOPS: Input & output per sencod.
<br> Type of EBS: General Purpose (SSD), Porvisioned SSD, Throghput Optimized HDD, SC1: Cold Storage HDD.
<br> It should be in same availability zone.
<br> EBS Snapshots: are used to backup, it will store in amazon S3.
